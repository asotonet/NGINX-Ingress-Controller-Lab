# Traffic Splitting

This use case configures traffic splitting for a sample application with two services: `coffee-v1-svc` and `coffee-v2-svc`
90% of the `coffee` application traffic is sent to `coffee-v1-svc` the remaining 10% to coffee-v2-svc

This use case shows how to enforce JWT authentication at the NGINX Ingress Controller level

Get NGINX Ingress Controller Node IP, HTTP and HTTPS NodePorts
```code
export NIC_IP=`kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=nic -n nginx-ingress -o json|jq '.items[0].status.hostIP' -r`
export HTTP_PORT=`kubectl get svc nic-nginx-ingress-controller -n nginx-ingress -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'`
export HTTPS_PORT=`kubectl get svc nic-nginx-ingress-controller -n nginx-ingress -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[1].nodePort}'`
```

Check NGINX Ingress Controller IP address, HTTP and HTTPS ports
```code
echo -e "NIC address: $NIC_IP\nHTTP port  : $HTTP_PORT\nHTTPS port : $HTTPS_PORT"
```

`cd` into the lab directory
```code
cd ~/NGINX-Ingress-Controller-Lab/labs/4.traffic-splitting
```

Deploy the sample web applications
```code
kubectl apply -f 0.cafe.yaml
```

Publish the application through NGINX Ingress Controller applying the traffic splitting rule
```code
kubectl apply -f 1.virtual-server.yaml
```

Check the newly created `VirtualServer` resource
```code
kubectl get vs -o wide
```

Output should be similar to
```
NAME   STATE   HOST               IP    EXTERNALHOSTNAME   PORTS   AGE

Describe the `cafe` virtualserver
```code
kubectl describe vs cafe
```

# Test application access

Access the application
```code
curl -H "Host: cafe.example.com" http://$NIC_IP:$HTTP_PORT/coffee
```

90% of responses will come from `coffee-v1-svc` and be similar to
```
Server address: 192.168.36.105:8080
Server name: coffee-v1-c48b96b65-6rlgx
Date: 03/Apr/2025:20:42:14 +0000
URI: /coffee
Request ID: 7e5a8e7143f9f5341b9c19ee60e47b8b
```

10% of responses will come from `coffee-v2-svc` and be similar to
```
Server address: 192.168.36.104:8080
Server name: coffee-v2-685fd9bb65-xpgfl

Test access using the script provided. It sends 100 requests and shows the traffic split ratio
```code
. ./test.sh
```

Output should be similar to
